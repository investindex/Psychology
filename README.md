# Your psychology

This section is incomplete pending an analysis I need to do on market timing.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYsVkPtcXk&ab_channel=BenFelix) on market crashes by Ben Felix was released in the midst of the 2020 COVID-related stock market crash. Its timing within the crisis endows it with the feeling of a coach giving a motivational halftime talk as the team is losing badly. Ben gives exactly the right advice for dealing with losses and provides historical background.

### Invest all my money at once?

Many people struggle psychologically with the idea of investing all of their money at once — in a lump sum. The alternative is to invest it over some period — this is called dollar cost averaging. It functions as a regret avoidance technique. People who do this are worried they're investing in the next May 2008, shortly before a major market decline. So instead, they might invest 10% on the first day of each month for ten months, so that they don't inject all their money in the stock market at the worst possible time.

The problem with dollar cost averaging is that it usually performs worse than investing a lump sum. This is true for a simple reason: the stock market tends to produce positive returns, and holding cash instead of investing usually constitutes a missed opportunity. Ben Felix conducted a [study](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing) of dollar cost averaging, and he discussed it [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). Vanguard also wrote a paper on this with a revealing title: "Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later". The bottom line of both of these studies is that returns from investing a lump sum beat returns from dollar cost averaging about twice as often as the opposite occurred.

For more details, I recommend watching the video. The ideal way to invest any amount of money is in a lump sum. If you choose to dollar cost average, make sure you have a disciplined schedule and that you don't attempt to engage in any further market timing.

And if the prospect of a market drop is so harrowing to you that you don't want to invest in a lump sum, then you should consider that your planned allocation may exceed your risk tolerance. Seriously considering dollar cost averaging, even though you're aware that it's a suboptimal approach, may be a sign that you'll struggle to cope with the volatility of your portfolio once you're invested.
