# Your psychology

Investing is an unusual field. As Morgan Housel noted in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSaRb-iFwPA&t=177s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), most people’s outcomes are far more attributable to their behavior than to their knowledge about investing. And as we discussed earlier, a large majority of professional active managers [underperform](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) index funds in the long run. This leads to the surprising conclusion that someone who knows only the basics but who exhibits great discipline can easily land themselves among the top 10% of lifetime investors. Housel's book _[The Psychology of Money](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Housel+The+Psychology+of+Money&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def)_ is a great read on various foundational lessons.

Some of the advice dispensed here will be debatable. It reflects only one approach to investing, which might be called "thoroughly informed and thoroughly passive". It embraces the use of evidence to understand the nature of risk and potential return, while also recognizing that financial markets are impressive aggregators of information. I will not recommend trying to outsmart markets by timing strategic trades or betting that prices will fall at particular times. I will not suggest practices that require you to be more informed or smarter than everyone else (note that this is possible for only a few people, by definition). Instead, I will encourage you to capture the rewards of the market in ways that anyone can accomplish, with the right behavior.

Planning and enforcing your own rational behavior is perhaps the hardest part of investing. Understanding your investments, selecting a great portfolio, using the right tax-advantaged accounts — these can be less important tasks than reminding yourself to adhere to some essential guidelines and avoid common errors. We'll walk through those here.

### Mistakes made when buying in

When first investing or when investing a large amount of money, many people struggle psychologically with the idea of investing all of it at one time — in a lump sum. The main alternative is to invest it over some period — a practice called [dollar cost averaging](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/dollar-cost-averaging). It functions as a regret avoidance technique. People who do this are worried they're investing in the next May 2008, shortly before a major market decline. So instead, they might invest 10% on the first day of each month for ten months, so that they don't inject all their money into the stock market at the worst possible time.

The problem with dollar cost averaging is that it usually performs worse than investing a lump sum. This is true for a simple reason: the stock market tends to produce positive returns, and holding cash instead of investing usually constitutes a missed opportunity. Ben Felix conducted a [study](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing) of dollar cost averaging, and he discussed it [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s). Vanguard also wrote a [paper](https://www.passiveinvestingaustralia.com/downloads/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf) on this with a revealing title: "Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later". The bottom line of both of these studies was that in historical data, returns from investing a lump sum beat returns from dollar cost averaging about twice as often as the opposite occurred.

In addition to this empirical result: if the prospect of a market drop is so harrowing to you that you don't want to invest in a lump sum, then you should consider that your planned allocation may exceed your risk tolerance. If you're seriously considering dollar cost averaging even though you're aware that it's suboptimal, it may be a sign that you'll struggle to cope with the volatility of your portfolio once you're invested.

For more details, I recommend watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s). The ideal way to invest any amount of money is in a lump sum. If you choose to dollar cost average (DCA), make sure you have a disciplined schedule and that you don't attempt to engage in any further market timing. The shorter the period over which you DCA, the better. So if you feel more comfortable investing 10% each day for two weeks, go ahead — it will barely affect your expected return.

"Dollar cost averaging" can also refer to investing over time as you receive money, usually by earning income. This is, of course, unobjectionable. The form of dollar cost averaging I argue against here means that someone decides to wait before investing money they already have.

#### Buy the dip?

Another common attempt at market timing is to wait until markets crash and preserve your cash for the opportunity to buy at low prices. Some people insist that "keeping your powder dry" is a great idea. Buy the dip! Fortunately, Ben Felix has [studied](https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-now-a-good-time-to-invest) the data on this as well. I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1qzuPRvsM0) and his more detailed discussion [on the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA&t=2242s). The problem with this strategy is similar to the problem with dollar cost averaging: holding cash instead of stocks is generally a bad idea. Major drops are rare enough that by the time they happen, you've missed out on so much growth that, on average, you've lost money compared to simply investing a lump sum right away. The other issue with this approach is that it's psychologically challenging to invest once the drawdown you've been waiting for arrives, since you'll likely be afraid of further declines and engage in more attempts at market timing.

These data don't stop some people from encouraging investors to hold cash that they're considering investing. Justifications like "The stock market is near record highs" are often used, as in [this Wall Street Journal article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-11492) from November 2013. A supposedly informed portfolio manager said in that article, "I wouldn't call this a bubble yet, but we see just about all asset classes as expensive, and we see very few opportunities in equities." Unfortunately for those who found the article credible, the total US stock market returned more than 16% in the following year and a cumulative 27% in the following three years. There is a surprisingly large contingent of people who become nervous when the market begins reaching all-time highs. You might notice that all-time highs sound like a natural consequence of an asset class that rises over time, but some people think they're a harbinger of market declines. As Ben Felix [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA&t=2913s) in the podcast discussion, the US market has spent about one-quarter of its history near or at all-time highs, and this condition does not tend to presage major declines.

&nbsp;

So please don't try to time the market. Keep it simple: do your research, decide on your portfolio, and invest in a lump sum. When new money arrives, usually through your income, keep adding to the portfolio without waiting for a moment that feels right. Once you accept that you can't predict what the market will do in the near future, this will make investing much easier! You can mechanically invest new money and rebalance without the psychological burden of wondering if each small decision will have positive short-term results. If you're investing wisely, short-term results should not be a source of concern.

Be the chad investor.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYsVkPtcXk&ab_channel=BenFelix) on market crashes by Ben Felix was released in the midst of the 2020 COVID-related stock market crash. Its timing within the crisis endows it with the feeling of a coach giving a motivational halftime talk as the team is losing badly. Ben gives exactly the right advice for dealing with losses and provides historical background.

Performance chasing and essentializing. US stocks have high returns and international stocks have low returns. Apple is a "good stock" that performs well.
