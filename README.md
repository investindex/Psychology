# Your psychology

Planning and enforcing your own rational behavior is perhaps the hardest part of investing. Understanding your investments, selecting a great portfolio, using the right tax-advantaged accounts — these can be less important tasks than reminding yourself to adhere to some essential guidelines and avoid common errors. We'll walk through those here.

### Mistakes made when buying in — invest all my money at once?

Many people struggle psychologically with the idea of investing all of their money at one time — in a lump sum. The alternative is to invest it over some period — a practice called dollar cost averaging. It functions as a regret avoidance technique. People who do this are worried they're investing in the next May 2008, shortly before a major market decline. So instead, they might invest 10% on the first day of each month for ten months, so that they don't inject all their money into the stock market at the worst possible time.

The problem with dollar cost averaging is that it usually performs worse than investing a lump sum. This is true for a simple reason: the stock market tends to produce positive returns, and holding cash instead of investing usually constitutes a missed opportunity. Ben Felix conducted a [study](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing) of dollar cost averaging, and he discussed it [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). Vanguard also wrote a [paper](https://www.passiveinvestingaustralia.com/downloads/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf) on this with a revealing title: "Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later". The bottom line of both of these studies was that in historical data, returns from investing a lump sum beat returns from dollar cost averaging about twice as often as the opposite occurred.

In addition to this empirical result: if the prospect of a market drop is so harrowing to you that you don't want to invest in a lump sum, then you should consider that your planned allocation may exceed your risk tolerance. If you're seriously considering dollar cost averaging even though you're aware that it's suboptimal, it may be a sign that you'll struggle to cope with the volatility of your portfolio once you're invested.

For more details, I recommend watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). The ideal way to invest any amount of money is in a lump sum. If you choose to dollar cost average, make sure you have a disciplined schedule and that you don't attempt to engage in any further market timing.

Another common attempt at market timing is to wait until markets crash and preserve your cash for the opportunity to buy at low prices. Some people insist that "keeping your powder dry" is a great idea. Buy the dip! Fortunately, Ben Felix has [studied](https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-now-a-good-time-to-invest) the data on this as well. I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1qzuPRvsM0&ab_channel=BenFelix) and his more detailed discussion [on the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA&t=2242s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast). The problem with this strategy is similar to the problem with dollar cost averaging: holding cash instead of stocks is generally a bad idea. Major drops are rare enough that by the time they happen, you've missed out on so much growth that, on average, you've lost money compared to simply investing a lump sum right away. The other issue with this approach is that it's psychologically challenging to invest once the drawdown you've been waiting for arrives, since you'll likely be afraid of further declines and engage in more attempts at market timing.

So please don't try to time the market. Keep it simple: do your research, decide on your portfolio, and invest in a lump sum. When new money arrives, usually through your income, keep adding to the portfolio without waiting for a moment that feels right. Once you accept that you can't predict what the market will do in the near future, this will make investing much easier! You can mechanically invest new money and rebalance without the psychological burden of wondering if each small decision will have positive short-term results. If you're investing wisely, short-term results should not be a source of concern.

Be the chad investor.
