# Your psychology

Investing is an unusual field. As Morgan Housel noted in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSaRb-iFwPA&t=177s&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast), most people’s outcomes are far more attributable to their behavior than to their knowledge about investing. And as we discussed earlier, a large majority of professional active managers [underperform](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) index funds in the long run. This leads to the surprising conclusion that someone who knows only the basics but who exhibits great discipline can easily land themselves among the top 10% of lifetime investors. Housel's book _[The Psychology of Money](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Housel+The+Psychology+of+Money&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def)_ is a great read on various foundational lessons at the intersection of money and human behavior.

Some of the advice dispensed here will be debatable. It reflects only one approach to investing, which might be called "thoroughly informed and thoroughly passive". It embraces the use of evidence to understand the nature of risk and potential return, while also recognizing that financial markets are impressive aggregators of information. I will not recommend trying to outsmart markets by timing strategic trades or betting that prices will fall at particular times. I will not suggest practices that require you to be more informed or smarter than everyone else (note that this is possible for only a few people, by definition). Instead, I will encourage you to capture the rewards of financial markets in ways that anyone can accomplish, with the right behavior.

Planning and enforcing your own rational behavior is perhaps the hardest part of investing. Understanding your investments, selecting a great portfolio, using the right tax-advantaged accounts — these can be less important tasks than reminding yourself to adhere to some essential guidelines and avoid common errors. We'll walk through those here.

## Mistakes made when buying in

When first investing or when investing a large amount of money, many people struggle psychologically with the idea of investing all of it at one time — in a lump sum. The main alternative is to invest it over some period — a practice called [dollar cost averaging](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/dollar-cost-averaging). It functions as a regret avoidance technique. People who do this are worried they're investing in the next May 2008, shortly before a major market decline. So instead, they might invest 10% on the first day of each month for ten months, so that they don't inject all their money into the stock market at the worst possible time.

The problem with dollar cost averaging is that it usually performs worse than investing a lump sum. This is true for a simple reason: the stock market tends to produce positive returns, and holding cash instead of investing usually constitutes a missed opportunity. Ben Felix conducted a [study](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/dollar-cost-averaging-vs-lump-sum-investing) of dollar cost averaging, and he discussed it [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s). Vanguard also wrote a [paper](https://www.passiveinvestingaustralia.com/downloads/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf) on this with a revealing title: "Dollar-cost averaging just means taking risk later". The bottom line of both of these studies was that in historical data, returns from investing a lump sum beat returns from dollar cost averaging about twice as often as the opposite occurred.

In addition to this empirical result: if the prospect of a market drop is so harrowing to you that you don't want to invest in a lump sum, then you should consider that your planned allocation may exceed your risk tolerance. If you're seriously considering dollar cost averaging even though you're aware that it's suboptimal, it may be a sign that you'll struggle to cope with the volatility of your portfolio once you're invested.

For more details, I recommend watching [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wzDp6ahvpU&t=2168s), which discusses a number of interesting points beyond the superiority of investing in a lump sum. If you choose to dollar cost average (DCA), make sure you have a disciplined schedule and that you don't attempt to engage in any further market timing. The shorter the period over which you DCA, the better. So if you feel more comfortable investing 10% each day for two weeks, go ahead — it will barely affect your expected return.

"Dollar cost averaging" can also refer to investing over time as you receive money, usually by earning income. This is, of course, unobjectionable. The form of dollar cost averaging I argue against here means that someone decides to wait before investing money they already have.

#### Buy the dip?

Another common attempt at market timing is to wait until markets crash and preserve your cash for the opportunity to buy at low prices. Some people insist that "keeping your powder dry" is a great idea. Buy the dip! Fortunately, Ben Felix has [studied](https://www.pwlcapital.com/is-now-a-good-time-to-invest) the data on this as well. I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1qzuPRvsM0) and his more detailed discussion [on the podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA&t=2242s). The problem with this strategy is similar to the problem with dollar cost averaging: holding cash instead of stocks is generally a bad idea. Major drops are rare enough that by the time they happen, you've missed out on so much growth that, on average, you've lost money compared to simply investing a lump sum right away. The other issue with this approach is that it's psychologically challenging to invest once the drawdown you've been waiting for arrives, since you'll likely be afraid of further declines and engage in more attempts at market timing.

These data don't stop some people from encouraging investors to hold cash that they're considering investing. Justifications like "The stock market is near record highs" are often used, as in [this Wall Street Journal article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-11492) from November 2013. A supposedly informed portfolio manager said in that article, "I wouldn't call this a bubble yet, but we see just about all asset classes as expensive, and we see very few opportunities in equities." Unfortunately for those who found the article credible, the total US stock market returned more than 16% in the following year and a cumulative 27% in the following three years. There is a surprisingly large contingent of people who become nervous when the market begins reaching all-time highs. You might notice that all-time highs sound like a natural consequence of an [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) that rises over time, but some people think they're a harbinger of market declines. As Ben Felix [mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA&t=2913s) in the podcast discussion, the US market has spent about one-quarter of its history near or at all-time highs, and this condition does not tend to presage major declines.

&nbsp;

So please don't try to time the market. Keep it simple: do your research, decide on your portfolio, and invest in a lump sum. When new money arrives, usually through your income, keep adding to the portfolio without waiting for a moment that feels right. Once you accept that you can't predict what the market will do in the near future, this will make investing much easier! You can mechanically invest new money and rebalance without the psychological burden of wondering if each small decision will have positive short-term results. If you're investing wisely, short-term results should not be a source of concern.

Be the chad investor.

## Mistakes made once invested

### Fear and greed

These two emotions can drive you to make unforced errors once you're invested.

If you read or watch financial news, it can be hard not to notice the people who are enjoying higher returns than you. Envy, greed, the fear of missing out — these are not known to promote rational thought. But they propel many investors to chase the recent returns of flashy investments, embrace extreme risk — sometimes without realizing it — or otherwise make unwise decisions.

Let this sink in now: there will always be investors with higher returns than you, and that's fine. You can remind yourself of a few principles. First, [a vast majority](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) of investors with unusually high returns at any given time will underperform the broad market in the long run. The stock market is a very noisy system, so it is utterly predictable that individual returns will vary widely (among people who don't simply invest in the cap-weighted global market). This would happen even if all investors were equally skilled, and all differences were due to luck. Because we can't assess the exact role of chance in any particular situation, it can be hard to appreciate that luck strongly influences the distribution of individual returns.

Second, many people have worse returns than you! Most investors under-diversify, pay too much in management fees, try and fail to time the market, panic sell after crashes, wait too long to re-enter the market, and make a hundred other mistakes. The small minority of investors who can consistently sit back and capture the rewards of low-cost, passive investing will perform better than almost everyone else.

And third, some people who appear to be outperforming your investments are not really doing so on a risk-adjusted basis. They are achieving great returns by accepting extraordinary risk. [Bill Hwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhMhg97fmzE) was a hedge fund manager who became a billionaire during the long bull market of the 2010s. In March 2021, his overextended investments finally collapsed. He lost many billions of dollars of his own money in a matter of days. For anyone interested, the link provides details on how this happened. The lesson for us here is that Bill Hwang became rich by tolerating a level of risk that would be unbearable to most people, and he lost everything for the same reason. It becomes easier to settle for normal returns when you appreciate that your boring diversified funds — which will never double your money in a week — also guard you against catastrophe.

&nbsp;

The second major source of unforced error is loss — and the panic, fear, and uncertainty that strike when your account is shrinking.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYsVkPtcXk) on market crashes by Ben Felix was released in the midst of the 2020 COVID-related stock market crash. Its timing within the crisis endows it with the feeling of a coach giving a motivational halftime talk as the team is losing badly. Ben gives exactly the right advice for dealing with losses and provides historical background.

A major point he makes is that bear markets are frightening in large part because of narratives about whatever crisis is causing an economic downturn. Narratives allow you to imagine the worst and forget what you know about rational investing. Even though global markets have endured world wars and major government collapses, scary narratives encourage you to think that this time could be different. [Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh9Gn58r9Fw) Ben Felix published during the COVID crisis was called "Bear Markets: This Time is Different (Every Time)". That phrase is a succinct way of expressing that while every downturn has distinctive aspects, the impression of this time being uniquely frightening is nearly always wrong.

<!--

There will never be a point at which the dark clouds pass away, stocks turn toward an upward trend, and it's totally clear that we've hit the bottom and are now recovering. The bottom of a stock market drawdown always occurs when the outlook is still bleak. We only know it was the bottom in retrospect.

Bias toward action

### Write it down

How can you resist the temptations of fear and greed? One of the best methods, in my view, is to write a mission statement for your investments. There's an example in this footnote<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> for a young person about to start investing.

The statement should be detailed, ideally describing how you'll invest your money and the specific allocations in each account. The example statement doesn't just explain what the person will do, but also what their financial goals are and how the actions in their plan will support them. Your justifications and goals may be quite different than theirs — it's just an example. Whenever you feel any doubts about your investment plan, you can return to your mission statement and reassure yourself that however you may feel about the state of financial markets, you carefully considered your plan before you wrote the statement and made commitments in writing. This doesn't mean you can never change your plan, but you should do so only with a calm mind after significant thought. Let the mission statement represent the conclusions of your most reflective self.

&nbsp;

### Stop looking at your investments

Mobile devices have made it possible for any investor to access real-time market data at any time, and to trade at a moment's notice with no human intermediaries. Is this good for you? Only if you can handle it.

Some people respond to this access by checking their investments multiple times a day. This will tend to make you think about altering your portfolio, and is more likely to depress your mood than if you check less often. Why? If you check the stock market once a day, you'll see red almost half the time. If you check once a month, you'll see green in perhaps two-thirds of cases. Checking once a year increases that probability to roughly three-quarters, and checking once every 20 years should always show positive results for a diversified portfolio. Checking less means you'll see more green!

So I have two suggestions.

(1) Check your portfolio as infrequently as possible. Unless you're different than most people, and you can watch market volatility with no thoughts about whether your allocation could use some tweaks, it's healthy to exercise some restraint. For some people it may be hard to limit themselves to once a day. Others may reach Friday evening and realize they haven't checked all week. If you're the former type, you may be at risk of stressing yourself too much when your investments are performing poorly. You should be investing some portion of your paycheck whenever you receive it weekly, biweekly, or monthly. So you'll view your account at that time, and it's good to do so occasionally.

(2) Don't look at your actual, hard-earned money too often. When you're curious about market movements, I think it's better to view a third-party website or app like Yahoo! Finance. You can create a custom watchlist with the funds you want to be able to check. The advantage is that when you open the Yahoo! Finance app, you won't have immediate access to trading and you won't see the actual dollar amounts. It's easier to see that [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) is down 1.3% today than to see how much money your account just lost.

These habits are meant to make you feel less concern about the volatility of your investments, and to help you avoid changing your investments for emotional reasons.

&nbsp;

## Mistakes made when exiting investments

In my view, there are three rational reasons for a passive investor to exit a position:

* (1) You need to liquidate your investments to spend the money in the near future.

* (2) You need to adjust the level of risk in accordance with the intended purpose of the asset.

* (3) You decided that your investment choices were unwise in the first place.

## Why beating the market is fundamentally difficult

"Beating the market" can be defined in various ways, but here I'll define it as outperforming the risk-adjusted return of an [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp). An asset class is a group of investments that exhibit similar behavior and draw on the same sources of risk and expected return. It's not hard to outperform the aggregate bond market: just invest in long-term bonds or high-yield bonds, and in the long run your riskier investments will beat those of the average bond investor. The same goes for outperforming the cap-weighted stock market: as we'll discuss in a [later section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio), you can increase expected return by investing in riskier stocks. The question is, why is it so hard to select investments with higher long-term performance without taking higher risk? Why is it [so rare](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) that active managers beat broad stock market indices at all?

We could discuss proximate [reasons](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) for why it's hard to outperform passive investors: the [positive skew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek) of stock returns, the high fees charged by actively managed funds, the tendency for higher turnover to lead to less tax-efficiency, or the difficulty of maintaining outperformance as your assets under management grow larger. But I think it would be most useful to describe why prediction in financial markets is fundamentally different than prediction in many other domains.

Consider the prediction of solar eclipses, a phenomenon that is unaffected by human action. Prediction of solar eclipses is so enviably accurate that I already know the locations from which my descendents could view a total solar eclipse on [July 16, 2186](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_July_16,_2186). We know it will be the longest total solar eclipse since the dawn of written history, and for thousands of subsequent years as well. Sometimes prediction works like this: gather enough accurate information, apprehend the pattern, and you can make reliable forecasts of the far future.

Prediction of financial markets is totally unlike prediction of natural phenomena. If everyone agrees that an eclipse will occur on July 16, 2186, the agreement itself has no effect on whether it actually happens. But markets are informationally adversarial environments. If new information reveals that a company's stock is undervalued, all participants are incentivized to buy shares, driving up the price until it's no longer judged as undervalued. New public information tends to be factored into the market's judgment of a fair price very quickly. What does this imply about an individual's ability to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis? Outperformance has nothing to do with how smart or informed you are from an objective perspective. Smart, informed people can reliably predict eclipses and other phenomena that stand still while you inspect them. But investment performance is a relative game: what matters is how smart and informed you are _relative to other participants_. The average investor — before trading costs, fees, and taxes — gets the market return. That is what the passive investor accepts. Active traders win or lose relative to the market return. Some of the losers are bright people equipped with knowledge and rareified data. They don't lose because they're objectively bad players. They lose because their trading is largely a competition with other highly skilled active investors, and someone has to lose. Note that "losing" doesn't always imply a negative return; it implies a worse return than the market.

Some people comprehend this and decide they're going to risk underperformance for the possible glory of outperformance. In my view, most people should recognize the merits of passive investing. After trading costs, fees, and taxes, the passive investor who accepts "average" performance is actually [far above average](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v74.n1.4). They're also likely to spend far less time deliberating and stressing than the active traders they're outperforming. As explored in other sections, seeking higher return by accepting more risk is a much more reliable method in the long run than attempting it through brainpower alone.

&nbsp;

## Common fallacies for investors

We'll conclude with some widespread psychological pitfalls that I think investors should be careful to avoid.

&nbsp;

#### Essentializing narrow investments as "good" or "bad"

It's widely said that you should own stock in "good" companies, and not "bad" companies. There are also, reportedly, "good" and "bad" countries to invest in. Arguments for these labels tend to rely on past returns, especially recent past returns. Let's review a few examples of why essentializing narrow investments as good or bad is not sensible.

Between 1970 and 1989, the MSCI Japan index delivered an average annual return of 22.4%. Some quick math shows that 22.4% annual returns for 20 years lets an investor multiply their money by 1.224^20 = 57! For comparison, a typical 8% return delivers a measly 20-year multiplier of 4.7. These gains were staggering. Japan had the largest stock market in the world in 1989 and, especially for domestic investors, Japanese stocks were a "good" investment. You can probably guess the outline of what happened next: Japan's market crashed in 1990 and suffered through two decades of very poor performance, followed by middling performance in the most recent decade. So is Japan a good or bad country to invest in? This example is meant to illustrate why essentializing a single country's stock market as good or bad is misleading. This is especially true if someone points to recent past returns to justify it.

Let's try a more fun illustration: Monster Beverage ([MNST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MNST)). MNST has the best average returns of any stock I'm aware of. Someone who bought $10,000 of shares at the beginning of 1996 and touched nothing would have held over [$60 million](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1996&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=MNST&allocation1_1=100) of shares by the early 2020s. However, shortly after going public in August 1995, MNST [suffered](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MNST/monster-beverage/stock-price-history) a 58% drawdown before its legendary performance commenced. Even the "best" stock ever has experienced terrible returns during some periods, and some investors surely lost money on the stock.

Note the distinction between these two statements: (A) "Monster stock has great returns" and (B) "Monster stock has had great past returns". Statement (B) is an objective observation, but statement (A) implies properties about an investment that do not reliably persist. Monster stock may or may not perform well in the future. Narrow investments do not follow predictable patterns that we're accustomed to in many other domains. If we've been happy with a carpenter's work in the past, we can hire him again with an expectation that the quality of his work will persist. Or if last season, a baseball player hit a record number of home runs, we can reasonably predict that he'll perform well again this season. __I can't emphasize enough that financial investments are just not like that — their returns don't have persistent properties. The entire Japanese stock market can experience two decades of eye-watering returns, followed by two decades of malaise, and that is totally normal.__

A common debate among investors is about whether to overweight the US stock market given how well it performed recently ([16.3%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2012&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100) average annual returns from 2012-2021). In my view, the tendency to essentialize investments as good or bad has caused many people to see US stocks as inherently better than ex-US stocks. For some, it is almost impossible to look at the radical US outperformance of the last decade and imagine ex-US stocks performing better in the future. The US market is "good", international markets are "bad". I think this is reinforced by home country bias, which is the tendency of people everywhere to overweight investments in their own country. But in efficient markets, we wouldn't expect a country's stock market to have higher expected return unless it carried higher risk. The US is certainly not a high-risk environment compared to emerging markets like China or Russia. Of course, markets like the US and Japan can have _unexpected_ returns, and unexpected returns are the norm in stock markets! But that doesn't mean we should bet on unexpectedly high or low returns persisting in any market, just because they happened in the recent past. In the [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio), I elaborate on why home country bias or bias toward recently high returns is not a good idea.

&nbsp;

#### Mental accounting

Mental accounting is the tendency to mentally group your money and treat those groups in different ways, even if there is no real distinction between the groups. A common example is that people treat money with less care if they received it unexpectedly — perhaps from a tax refund, a lottery ticket, or a performance bonus at work. People are often more willing to spend this money or, when investing, take high risk with it.

Here's another one: would you drive 40 minutes to a distant vendor to save $100 on a $300 kitchen appliance? Many people would. Would you drive 40 minutes to another dealership to save $100 on a $30,000 car? Many people would regard that difference as a rounding error in the context of buying a car. But in both situations, you have the chance to be paid $100 for two 40-minute trips.

Mental accounting can produce more harmful financial behaviors. Imagine someone in $20,000 of credit card debt with 22% interest. There is nothing better they could do with their money than to pay off that super high-interest debt. Yet many people with significant credit card debt accumulate savings. This person might feel that having $7,000 saved in the bank is an important goal, because it makes them feel secure in case of emergency. But what is the worst case scenario for someone in credit card debt who plows almost all their savings into paying the debt? If they ended up needing the money in an emergency, they could use the credit cards to take out more debt, ending up no worse (and probably better) than if they had kept the savings. Unfortunately, some people experience such negative feelings about having no savings that they're willing to pay 22% interest to keep money sitting in the bank.

Although mental accounting can be irrational, some people prosecute the issue too zealously. It is not true that "all dollars are fungible", as is [often stated](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mentalaccounting.asp) when discussing this fallacy. Tax laws are the main reason why money can legitimately be separated into different buckets. The dollars in my checking account can be freely accessed if I need to spend them. If I were to withdraw the money in my traditional IRA because I needed to spend it, I would pay income tax as well as a 10% tax penalty on that withdrawal. Those dollars are _not_ fungible! The psychological isolation of retirement accounts from normal money is actually one of their great benefits. You can invest in a retirement account knowing that you won't touch the money until old age. Hopefully, this improves your tolerance for volatility and makes it more bearable to invest in risky assets with high expected return.

&nbsp;

#### Endowment effect

The [endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) is the tendency to value things more highly merely due to owning them. In many studies, the lowest price at which a person offers to sell an item is higher than the price they're willing to pay for the same item. It has some overlap with [status quo bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias), a potentially irrational tendency to favor current circumstances over alternatives.

This can present itself in investing, sometimes with large financial consequences. Some employees, especially at publicly listed companies, receive stock in their employer's company as part of their compensation. Although it can come with strings attached, many employees keep their stock long after they could've sold it and bought shares of a diversified fund. For some people, company stock eventually becomes a significant portion of their net worth.

Deciding exactly how much company stock to keep is a decision that depends on many factors. I will suggest that there are ways of approaching it that help counter our natural status quo bias. You can ask yourself, "If I didn't own any company stock right now, would I sell my index funds to buy it?" Or, perhaps more neutrally, "If I were currently holding my entire net worth in cash, how would I choose to allocate it?" Often, when asked from this perspective, people realize that they would never choose to invest 20% or 50% of their net worth in a single company's stock. In fact, they never actually _chose_ to do that. It happened to them, and they accepted it. This practice is even riskier given that your company's prospects are linked to the stock price _and_ your job security. If the company flops, the stock price could plummet at the same time you're laid off.

This approach of taking an impartial perspective helps in many other situations. Perhaps you've learned something new about investing and begin to doubt that your current portfolio is ideal. Perhaps you inherited an investing account from a parent and you're deciding whether to change the investments. Of course, there are tax consequences to adjusting a portfolio in a taxable account, and this should be considered. But whenever you find yourself trying to make a decision, make a point of framing it in a way that does not privilege the status quo. Your mind is already doing that for you.

&nbsp;

#### Judging the quality of your investments by (short-term) outcomes

In most domains, it's assumed that learning from the outcomes of your actions is wise. If you study for an exam and fail, you should adjust your study habits. But in order to learn from experience, feedback has to be clear and the reasons for success or failure need to be identifiable and repeatable. Ideally, the feedback is also fairly prompt: it doesn't take years to gather a meaningful amount of information. In the domain of selecting good investments, all of these factors are lacking, making it [unusually difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8gH5bR3clg) to learn from experience.

The first issue is that feedback is not clear — it's extremely noisy. If you carefully select a particular investment that performs well in the first year, how can you know whether it was due to your skill, or due to good luck? The [evidence](https://github.com/investindex/Index#f2) indicates that while some actively managed funds outperform their benchmark in any given year, nearly all of these funds eventually underperform on a longer timeline. Luck feels like skill until it runs out.

The second issue is that it's extremely difficult to identify the variables that need to change to improve your outcome. If you gave yourself time to study only half the material for an exam, you can infer that giving yourself more time to study would've improved your score. But human intuition is a feeble tool for some uses. If your portfolio has disappointing results, what variables could have altered the outcome? Will the behavior of those variables persist in the future? Many people regret not picking investments that performed well in the past, and often change investments on this basis. Chasing the high _past_ returns of certain investments is a great way to underperform in the future.

Unfortunately, many people assume that they _can_ learn from their personal investing experience. If their portfolio performs badly for the first year — or compares poorly to some benchmark they've chosen — they might decide that they've learned something about the quality of their portfolio. Maybe they should change it based on the data they've collected in the last year. The point here is to emphasize that a long-term investor can learn virtually nothing from a year of performance. Even ten years of performance gives us very little information. This statement would probably sound absurd to some people — in almost any other domain, ten years is a _long_ time. But you should think about market returns almost as a geologist would think about Earth's history, or an astrophysicist would think about the history of the universe. In those contexts, a decade of data is uninformative, because meaningful patterns are observable only on scales of thousands, millions, or billions of years.

Financial markets are not quite as remote from human experience, but consider how much ten-year periods can differ from one another. Investing $10,000 in the total US stock market at the beginning of 2000 would have left you with [$9,732](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2000&firstMonth=1&endYear=2009&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTSMX&allocation1_1=100) at the end of the decade. Investing in the same market for a decade at the beginning of 2012 would instead have turned $10,000 into more than [$45,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2012&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VTI&allocation1_1=100). Should we learn from the first decade that US stocks are a terrible investment? Or should we learn from the second decade that US stocks are a miraculous way to generate wealth, with little potential downside? The actual lesson is that, in systems as noisy as stock markets, even a full decade of information does not help us learn much about what to expect in the future.

If financial markets are as mystifying as I say, how can we learn anything from history? Instead of using narrow personal experience, I would advise using sources of data that are as broad as possible. Depending on the form of data, we have access to a few decades to a few centuries of information about financial markets. We also have data from dozens of different countries, not just the United States! We should use these data to form testable theories about how markets work, and only then can we make well-grounded projections about the future. The [section on stock portfolios](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) discusses how to combine theory and data to build evidence-based portfolios.

Finally, even though you can't use your personal experience to pick better investments, there are a few ways you can learn from mistakes. Let's say you were invested in stocks in the late 2000s when the market crashed. After watching the terrifying news on CNBC every day, you sold at a major loss, trying to protect yourself from a total collapse. Even though the market was on a general upward trend after March 2009, the wild volatility of the next few years kept you on the sidelines. You were so rattled by your experience and the possibility of buying right before another market crash that you didn't invest much money again until 2016, missing out on years of gains. Can we learn from this mistake? Yes, we absolutely can. The cause of failure is identifiable — selling due to loss and waiting a long time to re-enter. Should we expect the same factors to cause success or failure in the future? Yes, staying invested instead of panic selling is expected to be a successful approach in the future for a diversified investor. This expectation is based on long historical data and the [persistent tendency](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23830) for returns to be very high right after downturns.

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> <b> Mission statement example </b>

"I believe that passive, low-cost investing in diversified funds is the best practice for me, because the evidence indicates that this is the most reliable way to produce good investment returns. I'm saving and investing with the goal of financial independence between the ages of 60 and 65, which means that I'll be able to live indefinitely on my investment earnings. Even before I reach financial independence, saving and investing consistently will give me more freedom in how I choose to spend my time. I'll invest in an allocation that meets my risk tolerance for each portion of my assets. The money I may need in the near future will be in low-risk funds, while the money I'm setting aside for the long run will be in high-risk funds. I'm committed to not altering my risky, long-term portfolio beyond basic rebalancing. It will be tempting to change my long-term portfolio or even sell all my shares when it's performing poorly. But I understand that downturns are inevitable, and that my investments will eventually recover, because I selected a diversified portfolio that I'm comfortable with regardless of market conditions.

Not only will I not change my long-term portfolio when it's crashing, I will not stop contributing to it, because changing contributions in response to market movements is another form of ill-advised market timing. From each after-tax paycheck, at least 5% will be contributed to my Roth 401(k) account, and I'll transfer at least 10% to my taxable account. I'll also contribute enough to max out my Roth IRA and HSA by the end of each year. I'll buy shares as soon as the money becomes available, and won't try to time the market. This is not only optimal, but investing mechanically reduces my stress because I don't have to constantly make decisions.

My Roth IRA, Roth 401(k) account, and HSA will all be invested in the long-term portfolio. At least 40% of the money transferred to my taxable account will be invested in the long-term portfolio, but that account will also contain low-risk bond funds for more immediate financial needs. Any money I don't need in my checking account will be placed in suitable funds in my taxable account, and I'll transfer money back to my checking account only if I need it. This will encourage me to save it. I won't withdraw any money from my retirement accounts before age 59½, except as a last resort. I'll move money out of my long-term portfolio into less risky funds only when the need for that money is approaching. For example, one of those needs might be a down payment on a home. I'll also begin gradually de-risking my retirement portfolio at age 50. Whenever my income increases, I’ll increase my savings rate in my taxable account and Roth 401(k). I’ll also evaluate whether I should shift partly or completely to traditional retirement contributions.

My risky, long-term portfolio is the complex portfolio [here](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#example-portfolios). For low-risk investing, I'll use a combination of [Series I savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds), the short-term US Treasury bond fund [SCHO](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/scho), and the moderately risky bond fund [DFCF](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfcf/core-fixed-income-etf)."
